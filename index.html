                            <h2> Project: LX </h2>
                            <p>
                                LX is my custom language built on top of the LLVM toolchain.
                                It is written in a combination of C++ and C#.
                                Currently the language only supports basic functions and integer variable manipulation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My end goal for the project is to be able to bootstrap the compiler
                                - in other words write the compiler almost completly in LX.
                                This project allows me to explore compiler design, language syntax design,
                                code generation with LLVM Intermediate representation and cross-language interoperability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Future goals for the project are to support more variable types (such as float or char),
                                control flow structures, memory management and user-defined types.
                                Some of the other features I would like to implement are a standard library,
                                Visual Studio extension and a cutom linker written in Rust.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                MinOS is my custom operating system written in ASM using the Fat12 file system.
                                Currnetly it only supports printing strings to the console and reading data from the hard drive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My end goal for the project is to be able to support C++11
                                allowing me to compile some apps on the operation system.
                                This project allows me to explore computer architecthure, low level programming skills,
                                memory management and kernel level development.

                                'Penguin Chase' is a game about chasing other penguins down a hill
                                and to get to the end before them without crashing into any
                                obstacles along the way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project was developed with Unity and I was able to further
                                some of my skills within it such as procedual generation and custom
                                pathfinding. As it was developed in a group it improved my
                                skills within working in a team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was made by me and a group of 3 others
                                who worked on the art assets and managing the development for a
                                competion in my collage. In the competion it won both 'Player choice'
                                and 'Industry choice'.

                            <p>
                                'The Mobius Line' is a short game about travelling from
                                one platform to the other as fast as you can. The game is 
                                built around non-Euclidean concepts which means the normal
                                rules of geometery do not apply. This was my Final Major Project
                                of the first year of Level-3 Game Development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As this project uses non-Euclidean mechanics it required me to
                                learn certain skills such as custom render pipelines and custom
                                physics to propely simulate the mechanics.
